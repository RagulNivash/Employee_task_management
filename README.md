# Employee_tast_management
You will design a company task assignment for a small company (10 members, two departments) where all the employee members can use it with the following conditions:
1) General managers have full access to assign tasks to managers and workers (the hierarchy of the company is three levels (general manager, managers, and workers).
2) Department managers can’t assign tasks to peer managers, he/she can assign tasks to their department workers. Can’t assign more than 3 tasks per worker.
3) Any worker can access all unassigned tasks in his department, and they can assign tasks to themselves only.
4) General manager can view all tasks status (unassigned, assigned, pending, resolved) for all tasks and employees. The report shows task status, name, ID, and worker name.
5) Managers can cancel assigned tasks of their department tasks.
6) Workers can’t cancel assigned tasks.
7) Notification for general managers and department local managers for the newly assigned task.
8) Manager must ask permission from the general manager to cancel or reassign the task.
You should:
1. Rewrite the requirements and system description into user stories.
2. Show business model actions flow, as a diagram.
3. Create the needed UML diagrams for this application showing all attributes and methods needed to complete all requirements.
4. Do a plan of your work with activities and time you estimate (guess) it will take you to complete.
5. Implement the application in the language of your preference. The application must run on a windows pc. The user interface can be via the console menu.
6. As you work on your project, record the time each activity takes you (if you must add activities to the plan, estimate a time also).
7. Present a report showing your diagram and its relation to your code structure and code.
8. Present a report of the plan, estimated time, and actual time to complete each activity.
